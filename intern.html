                <p>During her undergraduate studies, Gabriella spent multiple summers interning at architectural practices. Starting early after her first year, she interned at a small firm in Red Bank New Jersey called Settembrino Architects. There she learned the basics of AutoCAD and the Adobe suite, worked with the marketing coordinator on Color selections for projects, helped the executive assistant with AIA contracts and change orders, and other architectural practice tasks. She worked two summers and two winters at Settembrino, getting exposure in every area of practice, including site visits and client meetings.</p>

                <p>The summer after her third year she interned at Gensler's Morristown office. Gensler was a much larger office with four separate area divisions, each with its own intern. Gabriella was placed in the retail studio and was fortunate to work amongst a group of highly experienced architects. The Gensler internship was a unique experience in that as well as working on real projects, the other interns and Gabriella were given a group project to develop within the Morristown community. Working with other designers from different backgrounds was a new experience that taught the interns about understanding others' work and coherently communicating design ideas. </p>
